This exercise focuses on implementing **12 essential functions** in Java that cover core programming concepts such as:

### ✅ **Functions Overview:**
1. **Compute F(x)**  
   Computes the value of a polynomial at a given `x`.

2. **Polynomial root**  
   Finds an approximate root of a polynomial using recursion and bisection.

3. **Compute polynomial from up to 3 points**  
   Generates a polynomial representation from a set of 2D points.

4. **Equality check between two polynomials**  
   Verifies if two polynomials are equal within an epsilon tolerance.

5. **Polynomial to string**  
   Converts an array of coefficients into a human-readable polynomial string.

6. **Intersections**  
   Computes an approximate intersection point between two polynomials.

7. **Approximate arc length**  
   Calculates the length of a polynomial curve over a range using sample points.

8. **Area between two polynomials**  
   Approximates the area between two curves using trapezoidal integration.

9. **Parse polynomial from String**  
   Converts a string representation into an array of coefficients.

10. **Sum of two polynomials**  
    Returns a new polynomial representing the sum of two given polynomials.

11. **Multiplication of two polynomials**  
    Computes the product of two polynomials.

12. **Derivative of a polynomial**  
    Returns the derivative of a given polynomial.

13. **Additional Function**
    Helps calculate Multipication
